# Lugaw.Gay
It's the source code for my neocities site. It uses a modified version of the deploy to neocities action - [(Thank you, missmoss)](https://github.com/M1ssM0ss/missmoss/blob/main/.github/workflows/neocities.yml)! If you are also using 11ty, be sure to add the [11ty-dependency-tree](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-dependency-tree).

Feel free to nab any code, however, I am not the most competent coder, and I'm certain I'm doing a lot of things in a most un-optimized way! If you have feedback or critique, you can leave a comment on my [Neocities profile](https://neocities.org/site/lugaw), or send an email to Filipiniality @ protonmail.com.
