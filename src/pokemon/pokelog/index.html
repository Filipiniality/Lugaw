        <h3>Current Goals:</h3>
        <p>Taking a break in honor of CACA the Camerupt. Fly high, girl.</p>

        <h3>June 24</h3>
        <p>It is with a heavy heart that I announce the accidental deletion of my beloved Camerupt, CACA.</p>
        <img src="caca.jpg" class="center" alt="CACA the Camerupt in the Hall of Fame, pre-deletion.">
        <p>I was not paying attention while doing the Instant Pomeg Glitch, which always turns the second member of your party into a Bad Egg. I forgot to replace CACA with a trash mon, and now she is lost to the void.</p>
        <p>I was so in denial that I dreamt of her still being in my game's PC. I'm taking this as a sign to leave my pocket monsters alone for a while.</p>
        <h3>June 18</h3>
        <p>Did three rounds of the Battle Pyramid. Not much to say here because I think I'm already getting sick of the Emerald Battle Frontier. I'm gonna RNG manip/double corrupt a few pokemon in Emerald to send to Soul Silver and see if I like the Battle Frontier there better.</p>

        <h3>June 15</h3>
        <p>I have generated the Exit Code Bootstrap for more complex ACE codes. This little guy saved me hours of EV training (because he lets me edit the EV substructure of a pkmn directly).</p>

        <h3>May 25</h3>
        <p>I beat Emerald! More importantly, I used Glitzer Popping to enable Arbitrary Code Execution. Here is my pet Decamarks. Whenever I want to execute ACE I just look at him and he breaks reality for me.</p>

        <h3>Jan 16</h3>
        <p>Denise the Deino. If it was a boy it would be Dennis.</p>

        <p>My sibling started pronouncing Ghetsis as "gee-tiss" and I still haven't recovered.</p>
        <h2>2022</h2>
        <h3>Dec 1</h3>
        <p>One of my siblings and I were like "damn I miss the old generations" so we're replaying BW. I want to RNG manip my copy, but I need to be in the post-game for that, so I'm trying to speed through it. I named my character dipshit.</p>
        <p>P.S. We have decided to ignore the canon pronunciation of Ghetsis and will continue calling him "get-sees".</p>
        <h3>Nov 21</h3>
        <img src="sodium.jpg" class="center" alt="Marked birthday Pokemon, Garganacl">
        <p>It was my birthday! I didn't know there was a special mark you can only find for 'mons caught on your b-day, so it wasn't until I beat the game that I realized my Garganacl has the Mark of the Chosen One!</p>
        <h3>Aug 22</h3>
        <img src="gardenia.jpg" class="center" alt="Screenshot after beating Gardenia. Only one Pokemon didn't faint.">
        <p>POV you thought all the Revives gotten from the Sinnoh Underground would automatically be added to your inventory ;-; I could have save scummed once I realized my mistake but doing it this way felt more ~dramatic~</p>
        <h3>July 6</h3>
        <p>The French copy of Platinum that I ordered has arrived! I've never played this one; all my nostalgia is for Pearl only, but I took 3.5 years of French in high school, and I've played Y version in French, so I was confident I could get through this. When I started up the cartridge to see what I'm working with, I was surprised to see that the previous owner saved just before challenging the Elite 4! Her name was Maylisa, she played as Dawn, and here is her team.</p>
        <img src="maylisa1.jpg" alt="My SoulSilver trainer in the Union Room." class="center">
        <p>It felt like a waste to erase a file that was so close to the end, so I traded her Pokemon over to SoulSilver and grinded a bit so they wouldn't get wiped. I have a lot of fondness for Gen IV but the difficulty curve for the E4 makes no sense... Why is the Champion's team 10+ levels higher than Aaron's? Anyway, I thought it was very cute that Maylisa chose the Idol trainer class to be her avatar!</p>
        <img src="maylisa2.jpg" alt="Hall of Fame entry for the previous owner of the game" class="center">
        <p>The Tentacruel was her HM Friend, so when I was done training the other 5 'mons, I decided to let Maylisa borrow the shiny Lugia I had RNG'ed for. Here's everyone in the Hall of Fame.</p>
        <img src="maylisa3.jpg" class="center">
        <p>After the credits I ran around Sinnoh for a bit with her team, traded them back to SoulSilver, and started my own file. I like to take her Giratina on walks in the Pokewalker; the idea of strolling in the park with Pokemon Satan is very silly to me.</p>
        <h3>July 1</h3>
        <p>The JPN box copies of HG/SS that I ordered arrived. I cannot speak a lick of Japanese, but I know these games like the back of my hand, and it was "only" around $120 for both (still higher than the original retail value, but it's a steal considering ENG boxed copies go for $100~ each). The Pokewalkers aren't region-locked, so I'm using one of them for my ENG copy of SoulSiver.</p>

        <h3>June 16</h3>
        <img src="purble.jpg" class="center">
        <p>My first ever Emerald RNG manipulation! This took an entire afternoon following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XfmKlSojY">this tutorial</a>. I started from delay 0 and worked my way up, but my shiny frame ended up being on delay 9. In hindsight, if I had started at delay 10 and worked backwards, I could have gotten this 'kip in about 30 minutes.</p>
        <h3>Feb 3</h3>
        <p>Finally got to my childhood crush in PLA but I was beset by the weird yellow glow glitch... I was embarrassed he had to see me like this.</p>
