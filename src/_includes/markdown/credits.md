## Resources
* The SSG I use is [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).
    * I followed [this guide by Flamed Fury](https://flamedfury.com/guides/11ty-homepage-neocities/). I cannot stress how lost I was before finding this.
    * I was able to use [Markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it) thanks to [this github repo](https://github.com/pdehaan/11ty-658).
