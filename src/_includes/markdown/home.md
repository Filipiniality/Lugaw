Hey there! This is the personal site of one Hannah Banana.

I started this project in the summer of 2020, hoping that a nostalgia trip would ease my quarantine boredom. Did it help? Absolutely! Did it solve my displeasure for the internet? Only a little bit.

And to be honest, I was barely sentient during the late 90s/early 2000s! I wasn't allowed to use the internet unsupervised for *quite* some time.

Nevertheless, I'm happy to have my own corner of the web. The me of the yesteryears would be in awe of this spaghetti code.
