# Ort

I call it "ort" because it is a portmanteau of "old" and "art". It's stuff from 2020 and before, which isn't too long ago, but I haven't drawn anything since then. So these'll be different than something I draw today! Also some comments on the drawings, because why not.

#### Multimedia Stuffs

> (2019) I was really proud of those sunflowers, so I reused them on this website. I "rendered" them in Cosmic Blobs while I had Spider-Verse playing in the background. It played twice before I finished the flowers. The pixel-y stuff was made in DotPict on my phone. I drew Miles with a marker brush irl and colored it in CSP.

> (2019) Second foray into Cosmic Blobs. The phone is based on the cover of Jack Stauber's Baby Hotline. The background is a cardboard box that my sibling had been cutting up for their own art project. I made it all glitchy using [this Processing script](https://github.com/kimasendorf/ASDFPixelSort). This is technically also a collab with my dear friend Alice, because she redlined Doppio for me. [Look at how skinny and inaccurate he was before the redlines!](https://sta.sh/215r9maqbh2c)

#### No backgrounds here, but I'm still proud of them

<img src="Okina.png" alt="A sketch, bust-up drawing, and full-body drawing of Okina Matara from Touhou">

> (2020) I have lost the brush settings for this since then :( It was a very unruly brush but the thick gooeyness was kinda fun, if bad for drawing anything but moeblob characters.

<img src="Nessa.png" alt="Gym Leader Nessa. Kneeling while playing with her hair in one hand and holding a PokeBall in the other.">

> (2020) I wanted to draw all the SwSh gym leaders but I gave up.

> (2019 I think) My friend Alice's OC, [Anathema](https://toyhou.se/188579.anathema-human-).

> (2018) From late 2017 to 2019 I was extremely invested in Doki Doki Literature Club. I bought the Switch ver. but I haven't actually played it yet.

> (2017 I think) Redraw of a Steven Universe screenshot. After all this time I still have Complicated Feelings.

#### Comms I did that I'm still proud of
