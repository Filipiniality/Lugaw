<p class="caption">By Tatsuki Fujimoto. This has a special place in my heart because it is literally the reason I started reading the manga. I love the detail of his shadow <em>not</em> appearing through the curtains.</p>

<p class="caption">Credited to a longtime assistant. It was made during production, so this is possibly the first ever fanart? I think their toxic power couple energy really comes through here &lt;3</p>

<p class="caption">Credited to a friend who has since deactivated their twitter account. Mio ended up being my fav character outside of the main couple, and I think the artist made her look super cute and dainty!</p>

<p class="caption">Credited to a friend with no web presence. Very cute and simple style that harkens back to the early chapters.</p>

<p class="caption">To be quite honest, I think there is an uncanniness to this drawing - and it turns out that was intentional, because this was made by Shuzo Oshimi aka the creator of <em>Blood on the Tracks</em>! Aono's face structure really reminds me of Seiko... anyway, I also recommend BotT. Nothing supernatural there, but has the same kind of dread.</p>

<p class="caption">Credited to Taku Kuwabara, the creator of <em>Drifting Dragons</em>. Ngl I actually said &quot;woah&quot; out loud the first time I saw this.</p>

<p class="caption">Credited to a friend of the author. I realize this is the only drawing of Fujimoto I have on this page. Kind of befitting, considering his role in Aono and Kariya's relationship.</p>

<p class="caption">Credited to Hiro Kiyohara. Sadly, this is the highest res I could find. At first glance, the lighting on Aono's hair makes it look like the short hairstyle he had in the earlier chapters :(</p>
