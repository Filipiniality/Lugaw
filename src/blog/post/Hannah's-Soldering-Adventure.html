  <p>Before we get into the soldering process, let me wax poetic about my Game Boy and DS era. I am very sentimental for these Pocket Monsters.</p><p>In 2021 I got back into the older generations of Pok&eacute;mon. Specifically, gen 2, 3, and 4. Interacting with the Galar gym leaders in the SwSh DLC made me miss the weekly events in HG/SS. When I played it for the first time as a kid, I always looked forward to seeing the gym leaders out and about, taking photos with them, and calling them on the Pok&eacute;Gear. The Isle of Armor DLC was fun… but returning to Johto was even more fun!</p>
  <p>As much as I loved replaying Soul Silver - RNG manip’ing for perfect IVs and Shinies, fighting in the Battle Frontier - it had me yearning for the original experience. For starters, it is absurd how fast Gen 2 is compared to the remakes! I also really missed the original sound effects.</p>

  <p class="center caption">The purple GBA I've had for over a decade. I replaced the screen with the FunnyPlaying IPS v2 Backlight Mod.</p>
  <p>So there I was, digging up my ancient copy of Gold, when I remembered that the game is literally unplayable without a new battery. I knew a janky way to fix it - ripping out the battery and electro-taping a new one in - but the casing of Gen 2 Pokemon games are so beautiful, and it felt blasphemous to do that. I had done it before with my copy of Emerald, and I regret it.</p>
  <img src="../assets/images/soldering/solder2.jpg" alt="the crusty insides of my Emerald version." class="small right">
  <p>It was really difficult and really scary to take Emerald's battery out. That tape did not want to budge, and I was paranoid I would damage the cart. A GBA cartridge was never meant to have tape inside of it. It was crusty as hell in there, and I noticed that the front plate got cracked because of the extra height of the tape. I had to use an exacto knife to extract the old battery, and I'm so lucky I didn't damage anything important.</p>
  <p>Gold was my first time handling a soldering iron, and it was terrifying. It was worth it, to not have to go through the gauntlet of electro-tape all over again. But my process was not very futureproof - in a few years I will need to solder a new battery into Gold again. That's because I used a tabbed battery, which are generic brand and notoriously weak compared to duracell batteries.</p> 
  <img src="../assets/images/soldering/solder3.jpg" alt="battery retainer I accidentally broke" class="teeny left">
  <p>Luckily, the website I bought my new screen from ALSO sells battery retainers! Now I only have to solder the retainer in once, and every time I need a new battery, I just pop the old one out. But for Emerald, it was not so simple...</p>  
  <p>Saddest soldering attempt I ever did see. The retainer is not GBA compatible, despite what is says on the website. I wasted a lot of time trying to make it work, but I had to give up. This is the mangled retainer I ended up tossing. A working battery isn’t essential for Gen 3 games, unless you are really keen on growing berries. A silver lining is that a dead battery means I can RNG manip Gen 3. Prayer circle for me to get a Shiny mudkip with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARy_xSgXh2I">this tutorial</a>. I’m considering this experience a win because a) I didn’t burn my fingers and b) I cleaned up the gunk while I was in there.</p>

  <p>In stark contrast to that failure, here's my soldering job for Crystal! Now THIS is a solder project I can write home about. This game was my sister’s birthday gift to me last year. The old battery was already disconnected from the tabs because she treated the cartridge like a stim toy and shook it like a maraca when she This was a breeze compared to Emerald, because Game Boy Color carts are waaaay bigger and more accomodating for my fingers.</p><br>
  <p>The sparkly blue casing looks beautiful with my purple gameboy! All-in-all I’m satisfied with today’s project.</p>
