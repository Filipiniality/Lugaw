  <p>Thought I’d share all the crazy stuff that’s happened to me in the past month!</p>
  <p>So for starters, I’m now on “Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation” for my depression. This is week 6 of my treatment, and it will be wrapping up in early September. I’ve been resistant to anti-depressants, but I saw improvement very quickly with the TMS. The first few days felt very strange, and when I got home I’d take a lot of naps. But the first weekend after I started, I was already feeling happier and more chipper. I'm waaaay more proactive now. Like, before doing TMS, I would not have the motivation at all to build this PC. I also started reading and drawing for fun again.</p>
  <p>Now another thing… I got (lightly) rear-ended. The ironic thing was that we were on the way to the doctor. When I told my nurse about it, she wanted to focus on getting my neck treated instead of the thing I scheduled the appointment for. She was pretty aggressive about getting x-rayed right away, which I think will be a good look for us on our insurance claim. Plus, the original reason for my visit turned out to be a non-issue.
  The person who bumped into us had the audacity to suggest that my sister BACKED UP INTO HER. It’s so absurd it just looped back to being funny. I was hoping to get settlement money but it sounds like the other person’s insurance will only cover our chiropractor visits. :( I’m building my own PC and my first thought after hearing about the insurance process was “omg I can probably afford ray tracing now”. But alas, I will have to save up for an RTX without getting hit by a car.
  I'm honestly unsure if chiropractory works but it's free so why the hell not.</p>
<p>I’ve exclusively used laptops for the past decade, but the falling GPU prices and the death of my laptop pushed me into the PC building scene. RIP my laptop, I fucked around and found out. Looking back I’m surprised this thing didn’t die much sooner. I used to play Lobotomy Corporation for hours and it would make noises comparable to an airplane taking off (Lobcorp has a huge memory leak problem and was not meant to be played on only 8gb of RAM).

Now that I’m on desktop I’m thinking of rehauling a few portions of my site. I really love the bright Johto theme of the main pages, and the Windows 95 look of my About page, but those were the very first pages I coded, and the framework is super messy. I was just a baby web developer back then. My design philosophy at the time was "as long as it works" and that's why those pages are being held together by spaghetti.</p>
